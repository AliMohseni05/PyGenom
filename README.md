# PyGenom

###These functions cover:
- DNA sequence validation and manipulation
- Sequence analysis (GC content, motifs, entropy)
- Translation and codon usage
- FASTA/VCF format handling
- Primer design calculations
- K-mer analysis
The functions are designed to work with standard bioinformatics data formats and common genomics tasks. You can add these to your repository (I recommend GenPyTools as the name) and organize them into modules as your collection grows.
